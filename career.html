                    During my last work term, I worked at PCL as a Technical Solutions 
                    Analyst Student for an 8 month co-op term that began in January 2019. After 
                    my 8 month workterm, I continued working occassionally with PCL to support 
                    knowledge transfer for the software I developed.
                    <br> <br>
                    Through this job, I was able to gain experience working with C#, 
                    ASP.NET Core, JavaScript, and HTML. During my time at PCL, I primarily 
                    worked on two separate projects, one which was a Revit Add-In, and another
                    which was a website. The Add-In extracts data from 3D models for the purposes of 
                    monitoring design progression. The website utilizes the Autodesk Forge APIs to 
                    create a parameterized 3D model viewer that can be embedded in other locations. 
                    The website also extracts data such as version history from BIM 360 Docs to 
                    improve the viability of Docs as an Electronic Plan Room.

                    and for CMPUT 274 in the winter term of 2019. I held office hours to assist

                    I then continued working with ACFS as a Youth Social Media Intern from

                    working with HTML5 to create updates for the organization's website, as
