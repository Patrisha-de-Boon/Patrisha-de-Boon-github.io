                With a passion for problem solving, I have participated in every 24 hour hackathon 
                offered by the Computer Engineering Club of UAlberta since I have been in Edmonton. 
                In the second hackathon I attended my team Good Question won 3rd place overall for 
                our game "The Name of the Game". I have also participated in Computer Programming 
                Competitions with the University of Alberta Programming Competition Club.

                Currently, I have a particular interest in augmented reality and smart home 
                technologies, as well as learning how technologies like these can be used to 
                improve the everyday lives of the general public.
