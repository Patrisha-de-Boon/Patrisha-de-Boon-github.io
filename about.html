        <p>
            I am a 4th year Computer Engineering student in the Software Co-op option at the 
            University of Alberta. My next work term is an 8 month term beginning in April 2020.
            <br>
            With a passion for problem solving, I have participated in every 24 hour hackathon 
            offered by the Computer Engineering Club of UAlberta since I have been in Edmonton. 
            In the second hackathon I attended my team Good Question won 3rd place overall for 
            our game "The Name of the Game". I have also participated in Computer Programming 
            Competitions with the University of Alberta Programming Competition Club.
            <br>
            Currently, I have a particular interest in augmented reality and smart home 
            technologies, as well as learning how technologies like these can be used to 
            improve the everyday lives of the general public.
