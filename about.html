                I'm a Software Engineering student with a passion for programming and problem solving. 
                I'm currently in my 4th year of the Computer Engineering Co-op program at the University of Alberta, 
                in the Software Option.
                <br><br>
                I love challenging myself to learn new topics and improve on old ones. As a result, I have participated 
                in every 24 hour hackathon offered by the Computer Engineering Club of UAlberta since I have been in 
                Edmonton. In the second hackathon I attended, my team Good Question won 3rd place overall for our game 
                "The Name of the Game". I have also participated in Computer Programming Competitions with the University 
                of Alberta Programming Competition Club. 
                <br><br>
                I feel it is just as important to know a topic as it is to be able 
                to share that understanding with others. This is why I TA for CMPUT 274 and 275, and why I offered to 
                continue working with my previous co-op employer as needed to support my collegues as they worked with the 
                software I developed.
                <br><br>
                Currently, I have a particular interest in augmented reality, smart home, and wearable tech, as well as 
                learning how technologies like these can be used to improve our everyday lives. I have a strong belief 
                that it is our responsibility as software developers and engineers to continuously strive to improve 
                the world around us.
