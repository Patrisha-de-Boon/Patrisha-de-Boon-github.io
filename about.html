                    I'm currently in my final year of the Computer Engineering Co-op program at the University of Alberta, 
                    in the Software Option.

                <div class="body-title shaded">Passion For Learning</div>
                <div class="body-text">
                    I have a passion for learning and I enjoy challenging myself to gain new skills and improve 
                    on existing ones. As a result, I have participated in every 24 hour hackathon offered by the 
                    Computer Engineering Club of UAlberta since I have been at the University. In the second 
                    hackathon I attended, my team Good Question won 3rd place overall for our game "The Name of the 
                    Game". I have also participated in Computer Programming Competitions with the University of Alberta Programming Competition Club. 
                    <br><br>
                    Currently, I have a particular interest in augmented reality, smart home systems, and wearable tech, as well as 
                    learning how technologies like these can be used to improve our everyday lives.

                <div class="body-title shaded">Passion For Sharing Knowledge</div>
                <div class="body-text">
                    I feel it is just as important to know a topic as it is to be able 
                    to share that understanding with others. This is why I TA for CMPUT 274 and 275, and why I have consistantly  
                    continued working with my previous co-op employer as needed after the end of my work terms to support my 
                    collegues as they worked with the software I developed.
