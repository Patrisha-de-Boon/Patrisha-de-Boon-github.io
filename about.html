            I'm a Software Engineering student with a passion for programming and problem solving. 
            I'm currently in my 4th year of the Computer Engineering Co-op program at the University of Alberta, 
            in the Software Option.
            <br><br>
            I have participated in every 24 hour hackathon offered by the Computer Engineering Club of 
            UAlberta since I have been in Edmonton. In the second hackathon I attended my team Good Question 
            won 3rd place overall for our game "The Name of the Game". I have also participated in Computer 
            Programming Competitions with the University of Alberta Programming Competition Club, and I continue 
            to participate in club meetings.

            Currently, I have a particular interest in augmented reality and smart home 
            technologies, as well as learning how technologies like these can be used to 
            improve the everyday lives of the general public.
