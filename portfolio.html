                        The Name of the Game is a game made by the team Good Question 
                        (consisting of Patrisha de Boon, Arseniy Kouzmenkov, Joseph Meleshko, 
                        and Jacob Paton) during HackED, a 24 hour hackathon in 2018. This project 
                        won third place overall for this hackathon. 
                        <br><br>
                        The Name of the Game is a build your own platform style game meant to 
                        introduce people to the concepts of coding and using a terminal in order 
                        to accomplish a goal. In this case, the goal is to get the character 
                        from the start point to the finish line. The game is written entirely 
                        in C++ using the SDL 2 framework, and was made collaboratively using 
                        Windows, Linux, and Mac devices through GitHub. 
                        <br><br>
                        Part of the reason we chose SDL 2 as the framework for this game is 
                        because none of us had any experience with it prior to beginning the 
                        hackathon, and we enjoyed challenging ourselves to learn a new 
                        framework while building a complete project, all within 24 hours.

                        ChAI, or Checkers with AI, is an ongoing project. Currently, only the game 
                        portion is complete, and the AI is being developed. The game has a menu 
                        screen, save and load game features, and aesthetic options the user 
                        can change. Only multiplayer gameplay is currently supported, but an AI 
                        opponent is being created to allow single player gameplay against the AI. 
                        <br><br>
                        The goal is to create an opponent with multiple difficulties that the user 
                        can chose. Each difficulty will be based on a different heuristic for 
                        the minimax algorithm. In the future, machine learning may be implemented 
                        to create an AI with higher difficulty. The game itself is written in 
                        python, and the AI will be written in C++. The purpose of creating ChAI is 
                        to gain experience developing AI and to also gain experience making programs 
                        written in different languages communicate effectively and efficiently with 
                        each other.

                        Retro Bullet Hell is the CMPUT 275 final project made by Patrisha de Boon 
                        and Arseniy Kouzmenkov in 2018. It is in the 'bullet hell' genre and was 
                        heavily inspired by retro arcade games such as Galaga and Space Invaders. 
                        The game is made in python using PyGame. 
                        <br><br>
                        After the game is launched and a 
                        skipable splash screen has played, the user can navigate a menu using a 
                        keyboard or mouse. They can load a saved game if one is available, change 
                        the difficulty, view the recorded high scores, or start a new game. The goal 
                        of the game is to destroy as many enemy ships as possible before loosing all 
                        of your health.

                        Arduino Air Hockey is the CMPUT 274 final project made by Patrisha de Boon 
                        and Areseniy Kouzmenkov in 2018. The game is written in C++ and is meant to 
                        be uploaded to two separate arduinos, one which will be wired as the menu 
                        arduino, and one which will be wired as the game arduino. The arduinos 
                        communicate with each other through the serial port. 
                        <br><br>
                        After start up, the 
                        menu arduino displays a menu and takes user input from the game arduino to 
                        chose the game parameters, such as each player's colour choice and the score 
                        required to win the game. During game play, the menu arduino displays the 
                        current score while the game arduino receives user input and runs the game 
                        state. The reflection physics for collisions between the circular puck and 
                        the circular paddles is handled through calculations applied from linear 
                        algebra.
